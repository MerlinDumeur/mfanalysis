Monofractal Analysis
--------------------

Fractal analysis is a tool used to characterize the scale-free dynamic of scale invariant data.

Scale Invariance
````````````````

A function which has no characteristic scale, has its properties invariant under dilation. That is to say, given a function :math:`f` : 

.. math:: \exists \beta \ s.t. \forall \alpha, \ f (\alpha x) = \alpha^{\beta} f(x)

In scale-free analysis, there is no single scale that has more importance or meaning than the others: it is only concerned with factors independent of scale.

Power Laws
``````````
A power law is a relation of the form 

.. math:: f (x) = C x ^ {-\beta}

A power is trivially a scale invariant function, as :math:`f(\alpha x) = C (\alpha x) ^ {-\beta} = \alpha ^ {-\beta} f(x)`.
